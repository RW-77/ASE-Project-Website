# Our Team

### William Wu
William Wu is currently a rising senior at Stratford High School (2022). He plans to pursue a STEM related career, mostly likely related to computer science. He started coding at a very young age but didn’t take it seriously until he started to program for his robotic competitions in VEX IQ. He has experience in competitive robotics for roughly three years in middle school and started doing competitive coding since sophomore year such as participating in UIL as a junior where Stratford placed third place and doing USACO competitions. He is participating in CS club, BPA, NHS next year, and Focus Points. His skill set includes being able to code in Python, C++, and Java, having experience in all of Stratford’s engineering classes, problem solving and adaptability through his experiences in competitions, general understanding of robotics, and hands-on tasks due to mechanical work at home through robotics. Outside of his career and academic interests, William is heavily interested in marine biology, history, art, and philosophy. He spends the majority of his free time on drawing, and reading.

### Ivan Chan
Ivan Chan is a rising senior in Stratford Highschool (2022). He loves science and math, and is planning to major in Mechanical Engineering. He knows how to program in python and has taken all of the engineering courses offered at Stratford Highschool. He has also participated in many extracurricular STEM activities like Nasa Highschool aerospace scholars and Houston Prep at UHD. Ivan participates in Mu Alpha Theta, CS club, NHS, Focal Points Club, the Stratford Orchestra, and Academy of Science and Engineering.  Outside of his career and academic interests, Ivan is interested in  bouldering, stand-up comedy , and tutoring kids Algebra. For fun, He likes to hang out with his friends, play video games, and write jokes. 

### Caleb Xu
Caleb is a rising senior in Stratford High School (2022). In addition to having taken all computer science and engineering courses offered at Stratford. Outside of school, Caleb programs competitively in the US Computing Olympiad as well as for fun. He knows Java, Python, and JavaScript. He was a lab leader at LetsCodeSpringBranch, a student-led free summer coding camp which taught over 50 middle and elementary schoolers how to program using python. In the district regional UIL competition, he placed 4th out of 30 competitors, with his team placing 3rd. Caleb has honed rapid problem solving skills and knowledge of programming and engineering. He is a very hands-on person and thrives in settings where he can apply himself. Caleb plays on Stratford’s varsity lacrosse team and has been playing since freshman year. He is also a 2x state qualifier for the BPA Java Programming competition, and is founder and president of the Focal Points club. In his spare time, he enjoys programming, shooting lacrosse balls into his neighbors’ yards, and writing.
